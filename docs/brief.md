# Project Brief: LovingTree Lingo

### Executive Summary
This document briefs the creation of **LovingTree Lingo**, a mobile-first language learning application. It's specifically designed for American-born Chinese children learning Chinese, with content sourced from the "Jinan Chinese" curriculum. The project's core mission is to solve the problem of generic, cluttered, and non-child-friendly language apps by providing a simple, encouraging, and focused learning experience built with Chakra UI.

### Problem Statement
Many American-born Chinese children struggle to learn their heritage language with existing digital tools. Current language apps are often designed for adults, are overly gamified in distracting ways, or are not optimized for a mobile-first experience. This creates a frustrating and ineffective learning environment for young learners and their parents, hindering consistent engagement with the Chinese language.

### Proposed Solution
We will build a clean, intuitive, and minimalist web application that prioritizes a mobile-first experience. The app will focus on core learning modules: single Chinese character recognition, associated vocabulary, stroke order animation, and simple practice tests. By sourcing content from a structured curriculum ("Jinan Chinese") and using the accessible components of Chakra UI, we will create a non-intimidating and supportive learning tool.

### Target Users
* **Primary User:** American-born Chinese children (ages 6-12) who are learning Chinese as a heritage language. They need an engaging, simple, and visually appealing tool.
* **Secondary User:** The parents of these children, who are looking for a structured, curriculum-based tool to support their child's learning journey and track their progress.

### Goals & Success Metrics
* **User Goals:**
    * Increase children's confidence in recognizing and using basic Chinese characters.
    * Achieve an average of 3 or more completed lessons per user per week.
* **Business Goals:**
    * Acquire 10,000 user sign-ups within the first six months.
    * Maintain a 4.5+ star user satisfaction rating.
* **KPIs:** Daily Active Users (DAU), User Retention Rate, Lesson Completion Rate.

### MVP Scope
* **Core Features (In Scope):**
    * User Account Sign-up and Login.
    * A browsable library of single Chinese characters from the "Jinan Chinese" curriculum.
    * A detail view for each character showing pinyin, stroke order, and associated vocabulary.
    * Simple practice quizzes (e.g., multiple-choice).
    * A personal dashboard to track completed lessons and progress.
* **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    * Support for learning English.
    * Social features like leaderboards or friends.
    * Offline capabilities.
    * Speech recognition or writing practice.

### Technical Considerations
* **Platform:** Mobile-first Responsive Web Application.
* **Frontend:** React (Next.js) with Chakra UI.
* **Backend:** Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), such as Supabase, for authentication and database.
* **Hosting:** Vercel or a similar modern web hosting platform.

### Risks & Open Questions
* **Risks:** Licensing or sourcing the "Jinan Chinese" curriculum content; keeping children engaged long-term against highly gamified competitors.
* **Open Questions:** What is the long-term monetization strategy? How will we handle content updates for higher curriculum levels?

### Next Steps
* Use this brief as the foundation to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
