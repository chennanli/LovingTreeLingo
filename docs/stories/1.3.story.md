# Story 1.3: Character Library Display

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see a library of characters,
**so that** I can choose what to learn.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `/library` page displays characters fetched from the database

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create library page UI with character grid layout
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create `/library` page with responsive grid design
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Design character cards showing character, pinyin, meaning
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add character metadata (stroke count, difficulty level)
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Implement mobile-responsive grid (2/3/4 columns)
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Add hover effects and visual feedback
- [x] Task 2: Implement database integration for characters
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create character interface/types for TypeScript
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement Supabase query to fetch characters
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add sorting logic (by difficulty and stroke count)
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Implement error handling for database queries
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Create sample data fallback when database table doesn't exist
- [x] Task 3: Add navigation and user experience features
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create page header with title and navigation
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add loading state with spinner
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Implement error state display
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Add character count indicator
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Create links to character detail pages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- Authentication system is fully functional with protected routes
- Supabase integration established and working
- Chakra UI v3 compatibility issues resolved
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns established

### Architecture Information
[Source: architecture.md + PRD epic requirements]
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL for character storage
- **UI Framework:** Chakra UI with responsive grid system
- **Content Source:** Jinan Chinese (暨南中文) curriculum data
- **Navigation:** Links to individual character detail pages

### File Locations
Based on Next.js App Router conventions:
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/library/page.tsx` - Character library main page
- Character detail pages will be at `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/character/[id]/page.tsx`

### Technical Constraints
- Must display characters from Supabase database
- Fallback to sample data when database not configured
- Mobile-first responsive design required
- Characters should be sortable by difficulty and stroke count
- Each character card must link to detail view

### Database Schema Expected
Characters table should contain:
- id (string/uuid)
- character (string) - the Chinese character
- pinyin (string) - pronunciation guide
- meaning (string) - English translation
- stroke_count (number) - number of strokes to write
- difficulty_level (number) - learning difficulty (1-5)

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- Manual verification of character display
- Test responsive grid layout on different screen sizes
- Verify database connection and error handling
- Test sample data fallback functionality
- Confirm navigation links work correctly
