## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Supabase client is already configured at `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/lib/supabase.ts` with auth persistence enabled
- Chakra UI v3 is set up with Provider at `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/providers.tsx`
- Next.js 14+ App Router structure is in use
- Mobile-first responsive design approach established
- Environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are configured

### Architecture Information
[Source: architecture.md - High Level Architecture]
- **Authentication Provider:** Supabase Auth handles user authentication
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with App Router
- **UI Library:** Chakra UI for all components
- **Platform:** Application deployed on Vercel

### File Locations
Based on Next.js App Router conventions and existing project structure:
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page component
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/signup/page.tsx` - Signup page component
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utility functions
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Auth context provider
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom auth hook
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/middleware.ts` - Route protection middleware
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/components/auth/` - Reusable auth components

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Supabase Auth for all authentication operations
- All UI components must use Chakra UI
- Forms must be mobile-responsive and accessible
- Client-side routing with Next.js App Router
- TypeScript for type safety

### Supabase Auth Specifics
Based on Supabase documentation patterns:
- Use `supabase.auth.signUp()` for user registration
- Use `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` for login
- Use `supabase.auth.signOut()` for logout
- Use `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` for auth state listeners
- Session management is handled automatically by Supabase client

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
No specific testing framework found in architecture docs. For this story, focus on:
- Manual testing of all authentication flows
- Form validation testing with edge cases
- Mobile device testing for responsive design
- Session persistence testing across page refreshes
- Protected route access testing
