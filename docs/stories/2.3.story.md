## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1 and 2.2:
- Quiz system fully functional with result tracking
- Database functions getUserStats and getUserQuizHistory ready for integration
- UserStats interface includes all necessary progress metrics
- Authentication system provides user context for personalized data

### Architecture Information
[Source: PRD Story 2.3 requirements + existing progress tracking system]
- **Data Source:** getUserStats function from lib/database.ts
- **Display:** Enhanced /dashboard page with real progress data
- **UI Components:** Progress cards, statistics display, recent activity
- **Performance:** Consider caching strategy for frequently accessed stats

### File Locations
Based on existing architecture:
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Update existing dashboard
- Possibly create dashboard-specific components

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing authentication and database setup
- Handle cases where no quiz data exists yet (new users)
- Maintain responsive design for mobile users
- Consider performance with growing dataset

### Progress Metrics to Display
- Total quizzes completed
- Average quiz score percentage
- Best quiz score achieved
- Current learning streak (consecutive days)
- Total characters practiced
- Recent quiz history (last 5 results with dates and scores)
- Progress milestones and achievements

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- Test dashboard with various user states (new, active, returning)
- Verify proper loading states and error handling
- Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
- Confirm navigation between dashboard and other app sections
- Test progress calculations and statistics accuracy
