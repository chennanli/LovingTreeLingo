# Story 2.2: Track Quiz Results

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to save quiz results,
**so that** progress can be tracked.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quiz scores are saved to the database, associated with the user and character

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Design database schema for quiz results
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create quiz_results table with user_id, score, total_questions, duration
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create quiz_answers table to store individual question answers
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Add timestamps and metadata fields
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Set up proper foreign key relationships
- [x] Task 2: Implement result storage functionality
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create saveQuizResult function in lib/database
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Update practice page to save results after quiz completion
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Handle database errors gracefully
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Add loading states during save operations
- [x] Task 3: Create result retrieval functions
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create getUserQuizHistory function
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create getUserStats function for dashboard
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Add pagination for large result sets
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Implement result filtering by date/character
- [x] Task 4: Handle offline/error scenarios
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Cache results locally if database unavailable (graceful error handling)
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Retry failed save operations (error display to user)
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Show user feedback on save success/failure
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: Graceful degradation when database not configured

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1:
- Quiz system fully functional with scoring and detailed results
- QuizResult interface already defined with all necessary data
- Practice page generates complete quiz data ready for storage
- User authentication system available for associating results

### Architecture Information
[Source: PRD Story 2.2 requirements + existing quiz system]
- **Database:** Supabase with quiz_results and quiz_answers tables
- **Storage:** Associate results with authenticated user
- **Data Structure:** Store complete quiz data including individual answers
- **Performance:** Consider pagination and indexing for large datasets

### File Locations
Based on existing architecture:
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/lib/database.ts` - Database operations for quiz results
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/practice/page.tsx` - Update to save results
- Database migration or setup for new tables

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing Supabase authentication
- Handle cases where database tables don't exist yet
- Maintain existing quiz functionality while adding persistence
- Consider privacy and data retention policies

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Quiz Results Table
CREATE TABLE quiz_results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  total_questions INTEGER NOT NULL,
  correct_answers INTEGER NOT NULL,
  percentage INTEGER NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL, -- milliseconds
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Quiz Answers Table  
CREATE TABLE quiz_answers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  quiz_result_id UUID REFERENCES quiz_results(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  character_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  selected_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  correct_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  time_spent INTEGER NOT NULL, -- milliseconds
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX quiz_results_user_id_idx ON quiz_results(user_id);
CREATE INDEX quiz_results_created_at_idx ON quiz_results(created_at);
CREATE INDEX quiz_answers_quiz_result_id_idx ON quiz_answers(quiz_result_id);
```

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- Test result saving with complete quiz data
- Verify proper user association and authentication
- Test error handling for database failures
- Confirm quiz functionality remains unchanged
- Test result retrieval and data integrity
