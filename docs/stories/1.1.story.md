## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story for the project.

### Architecture Information
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Platform:** Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js application
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL Database, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo using Turborepo
- **Starter Template:** Standard `create-next-app` template

### File Locations
Based on standard Next.js project structure:
- `/pages/_app.tsx` - Main app component for Chakra Provider setup
- `/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `/pages/index.tsx` - Welcome page component
- `/styles/` - Custom styles and theme configuration
- `/turbo.json` - Turborepo configuration
- `/.env.local` - Environment variables (Supabase URL and anon key)

### Technical Constraints
- Mobile-first design requirement using Chakra UI
- Must use TypeScript
- Deployment target is Vercel
- Backend must use Supabase BaaS

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
No specific testing requirements found in architecture docs for this initial setup story. Focus on manual verification of:
- Build process completes without errors
- Chakra UI renders correctly on mobile devices
- Supabase connection is established
- Deployment to Vercel is successful

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundational work for a Next.js monorepo project. The developer successfully set up all core components including Next.js with TypeScript, Chakra UI v3 integration, Supabase backend connection, and Turborepo configuration. The code follows modern React patterns with proper use of client components and environment variable handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/lovingtree-lingo/components/SupabaseTest.tsx
  - **Change**: Refactored to eliminate ESLint warnings about unused variables
  - **Why**: ESLint warnings indicate code quality issues and should be addressed
  - **How**: Implemented proper state management with typed status states and removed unused destructured variables

- **File**: apps/lovingtree-lingo/lib/supabase.ts
  - **Change**: Added environment variable validation and Supabase client configuration options
  - **Why**: Fail-fast principle - catch missing env vars at build time rather than runtime
  - **How**: Added explicit validation with clear error messages and configured auth persistence

- **File**: apps/lovingtree-lingo/package.json
  - **Change**: Added type-check script
  - **Why**: TypeScript type checking should be part of the development workflow
  - **How**: Added "type-check": "tsc --noEmit" script for standalone type validation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows Next.js best practices and TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Monorepo structure properly configured with apps/packages separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ No tests required for initial setup story
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC4 incomplete - Vercel deployment pending (requires manual action)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed ESLint warnings in SupabaseTest component
- [x] Enhanced Supabase client configuration with proper error handling
- [x] Added type-check script to package.json
- [ ] Consider adding a format script for Prettier integration
- [ ] Address multiple lockfile warnings (cleanup duplicate lockfiles)
- [ ] Complete Vercel deployment when credentials available

### Security Review

- Environment variables properly prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side usage
- No hardcoded secrets found
- Supabase anon key appropriately used (designed for client-side usage)

### Performance Considerations

- Build output shows reasonable bundle sizes (99.6 kB shared JS)
- Static page generation working correctly
- Turbopack enabled for faster development builds

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The story implementation is solid with professional-quality code. The only incomplete item is the Vercel deployment which requires manual user action. All refactoring has been completed to bring the code to senior developer standards.
