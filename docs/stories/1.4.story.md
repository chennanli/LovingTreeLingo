# Story 1.4: Character Detail View

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to view the details of a character,
**so that** I can learn about it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Clicking a character navigates to a detail page showing pinyin, stroke order, and vocabulary

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Set up dynamic route `/character/[id]/page.tsx`
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement URL parameter handling with useParams
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create character interface with all required fields
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Add loading state and error handling
- [x] Task 2: Implement database integration for character details
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create Supabase query for single character with vocabulary
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Handle database errors and missing characters
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Implement sample data fallback for development
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create sample vocabulary words for each character
- [x] Task 3: Design character detail layout and components
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create large character display with pinyin and meaning
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Add character metadata badges (strokes, difficulty level)
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Design stroke order placeholder section
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Create vocabulary examples grid
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Add learning action buttons (disabled/coming soon)
- [x] Task 4: Implement navigation and user experience
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Add back button to character library
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Include navigation to dashboard
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Handle character not found scenarios
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: Ensure mobile-responsive layout

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.2 and 1.3:
- Authentication system fully functional
- Character library displaying characters in grid format
- Supabase integration with sample data fallback working
- Mobile-responsive design patterns established
- Navigation between authenticated pages working

### Architecture Information
[Source: PRD epic requirements + character library structure]
- **Database:** Supabase with characters table and related vocabulary
- **Routing:** Next.js dynamic routes `/character/[id]`
- **UI Framework:** Chakra UI with responsive grid system
- **Content Display:** Large character, pinyin, meaning, stroke order, vocabulary examples

### File Locations
Based on Next.js App Router conventions:
- `/apps/lovingtree-lingo/app/character/[id]/page.tsx` - Character detail page

### Technical Constraints
- Must handle dynamic ID parameters from URL
- Large character display optimized for mobile viewing
- Stroke order section prepared for future animation implementation
- Vocabulary examples displayed in responsive grid
- Fallback to sample data when database not configured

### Database Schema Expected
Character details query expects:
- characters table: id, character, pinyin, meaning, stroke_count, difficulty_level
- character_vocabulary table: id, character_id, word, pinyin, meaning
- Relationship between characters and their vocabulary words

### Sample Data Structure
Includes sample characters for:
- 你 (nǐ) - you - with vocabulary: 你好, 你们, 你的
- 好 (hǎo) - good - with vocabulary: 你好, 很好, 好的  
- 我 (wǒ) - I/me - with vocabulary: 我是, 我的, 我们

### Testing
#### Testing Standards
- Manual verification of character detail display
- Test dynamic routing with different character IDs
- Verify responsive layout on mobile and desktop
- Test navigation between library and detail pages
- Confirm error handling for non-existent characters
